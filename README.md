This is a repository associated with Python code used for digital elevation model conditioning (removing roads, stockdams, leveled cellular tower lots, and other modern infrastructure from digital elevation models) and generating least-cost path polylines to approximate the most likely former locations of bison drive lanes. The provided Python scripts/code relate(s) to the article DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL CONDITIONING AND ANALYSES TO DETERMINE VIABLE LOCATIONS OF PRECONTACT BISON DRIVE LANES ASSOCIATED WITH A NORTHERN PLAINS BISON KILL, 39HD115 by Alexander T. Anton in _South Dakota Archaeology_. The code was written as Python 2.7 code and uses the arcpy package associated with Esri's ArcMap software. An advanced license for ArcMap may be needed to run some of the arcpy tools called in the code. File paths within both scripts are hardcoded to the computer used to initially run the code and will need to be changed in order to run the code on a different computer with different input data. Please email antontalexander@gmail.com with any questions about the scripts in this repository.
