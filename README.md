This is a repository associated with Python code used for digital elevation model conditioning (removing roads, stockdams, and leveled cellular tower lots from digital elevation models) and generating least-cost path polylines to approximate the most likely former locations of bison drive lanes. The code was written to run in Python 2.7 and with the arcpy package associated with Esri's ArcMap software. An advanced license for ArcMap may be needed to run some of the arcpy tools referenced in the code. File paths within both scripts are hardcoded to the computer used to initially run the code and will need to be changed in order to run the code on a different computer with different input data. Please email antontalexander@gmail.com with any questions about the code/scripts.
